# Audit Logs

<Callout variant="gated-feature">
Audit logs are available on the <a href="/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enterprise plan</a>. Contact <a href="mailto:sales@modal.com">sales@modal.com</a> for more information.
</Callout>

Audit logs give your workspace an append-only record of the sensitive
actions that change its state — who did what, when, to which resource, and
from where. They are designed for compliance reviews, incident
investigation, and answering questions like *"did anyone delete this Secret
last Thursday?"* without asking Modal support.

Audit logs are viewable within the <a href="/settings/audit-logs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-c-green-100 hover:underline">settings page</a>.

## Fields

Every audit event captures the same shape alongside the time it occurred:

| Field                 | What it is                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`              | The kind of change that happened — e.g. `secret.create`, `app.deploy`. See the full list [below](#actions).                        |
| `actor`               | The user or service user that initiated the action.                                                                                |
| `targets`             | The resource(s) the action affected, each recorded by ID so the event stays attributable after a rename or delete.                 |
| `context.environment` | The environment the action was scoped to.                                                                                          |
| `context.ip_address`  | The client IP address.                                                                                                             |
| `context.source`      | `web` for the dashboard, `sdk` for the Modal CLI and client libraries.                                                             |
| `status`              | Whether the action succeeded or failed.                                                                                            |
| `metadata`            | Action-specific extra fields — e.g. the old and new budget values for `workspace.set_budget`, or the requested region for a Proxy. |

## Filtering

Filters are entered in the search bar above the table as `key:value`
pairs, separated by spaces. Any filter can be **negated** by prefixing it
with `-` to exclude matching events. The search bar autocompletes keys
and values as you type.

For example:

| Filter                                       | Matches                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `action:secret.create`                       | Every Secret created in the selected time range. |
| `-status:success`                            | All actions that did not succeed.                |
| `action:volume.delete` `-actor_type:service` | Volume deletions by non-service users.           |

## Actions

The table below lists every action currently recorded. New actions will be
added as additional workspace operations are instrumented.

> Note: **container runtime activity is not audited.** Audit logs record
> workspace-level actions (deploying an App, creating a Volume, revoking a
> token) — not individual Function invocations or Sandbox `exec` calls,
> which are captured in Function and Sandbox logs.

| `member.set_role`             | A workspace member's workspace-wide role (Owner / Manager / User) was changed. The affected member(s) appear in the event targets and the new role(s) are recorded in the event metadata. Per-environment access is set separately via `environment.update_member`. |
