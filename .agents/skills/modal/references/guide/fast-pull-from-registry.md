# Fast pull from registry

The performance of pulling public and private images from registries into Modal
can be significantly improved by adopting the [eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/estargz.md) compression format.

By applying eStargz compression during your image build and push, Modal will be much
more efficient at pulling down your image from the registry.

## How to use estargz

If you have [Buildkit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/) version greater than `0.10.0`, adopting `estargz` is as simple as
adding some flags to your `docker buildx build` command:

* `type=registry` flag will instruct BuildKit to push the image after building.
  * If you do not push the image from immediately after build and instead attempt to push it later with docker push, the image will be converted to a standard gzip image.
* `compression=estargz` specifies that we are using the [eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/estargz.md) compression format.
* `oci-mediatypes=true` specifies that we are using the OCI media types, which is required for eStargz.
* `force-compression=true` will recompress the entire image and convert the base image to eStargz if it is not already.

```bash
docker buildx build --tag "<registry>/<namespace>/<repo>:<version>" \
--output type=registry,compression=estargz,force-compression=true,oci-mediatypes=true \
.
```

Then reference the container image as normal in your Modal code.

```python notest
app = modal.App(
    "example-estargz-pull",
    image=modal.Image.from_registry(
        "public.ecr.aws/modal/estargz-example-images:text-generation-v1-esgz"
    )
)
```

At build time you should see the eStargz-enabled puller activate:

```

## Supported registries

Currently, Modal supports fast estargz pulling images with the following registries:

* AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Docker Hub (docker.io)
* Google Artifact Registry (gcr.io, pkg.dev)

We are working on adding support for GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).
