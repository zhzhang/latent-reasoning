# modal.Period


```python
class Period(modal.schedule.Schedule)
```

Create a schedule that runs every given time interval.

Only `seconds` can be a float. All other arguments are integers.

Note that `days=1` will trigger the function the same time every day.
This does not have the same behavior as `seconds=84000` since days have
different lengths due to daylight savings and leap seconds. Similarly,
using `months=1` will trigger the function on the same day each month.

This behaves similar to the
[dateutil](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/relativedelta.html)
package.

**Usage**

```python
import modal
app = modal.App()

@app.function(schedule=modal.Period(days=1))
def f():
    print("This function will run every day")

modal.Period(hours=4)          # runs every 4 hours
modal.Period(minutes=15)       # runs every 15 minutes
modal.Period(seconds=math.pi)  # runs every 3.141592653589793 seconds
```

```python
__init__(self, *, years=0, months=0, weeks=0, days=0, hours=0, minutes=0,
    seconds=0)
```
