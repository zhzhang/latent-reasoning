# modal.forward

```python
forward(port, *, unencrypted=False, h2_enabled=False, client=None)
```
Expose a port publicly from inside a running Modal container, with TLS.

If `unencrypted` is set, this also exposes the TCP socket without encryption on a random port
number. This can be used to SSH into a container (see example below). Note that it is on the public Internet, so
make sure you are using a secure protocol over TCP.

If `h2_enabled` is set, the TLS server will advertise support for HTTP/2.

**Important:** This is an experimental API which may change in the future.

**Usage**

```python notest
import modal
from flask import Flask

app = modal.App(image=modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("Flask"))
flask_app = Flask(__name__)


@flask_app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"


@app.function()
def run_app():
    # Start a web server inside the container at port 8000. `modal.forward(8000)` lets us
    # expose that port to the world at a random HTTPS URL.
    with modal.forward(8000) as tunnel:
        print("Server listening at", tunnel.url)
        flask_app.run("0.0.0.0", 8000)

    # When the context manager exits, the port is no longer exposed.
```

**Raw TCP usage:**

```python
import socket
import threading

import modal


def run_echo_server(port: int):
    """Run a TCP echo server listening on the given port."""
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", port))
    sock.listen(1)

    while True:
        conn, addr = sock.accept()
        print("Connection from:", addr)

        # Start a new thread to handle the connection
        def handle(conn):
            with conn:
                while True:
                    data = conn.recv(1024)
                    if not data:
                        break
                    conn.sendall(data)

        threading.Thread(target=handle, args=(conn,)).start()


app = modal.App()


@app.function()
def tcp_tunnel():
    # This exposes port 8000 to public Internet traffic over TCP.
    with modal.forward(8000, unencrypted=True) as tunnel:
        # You can connect to this TCP socket from outside the container, for example, using `nc`:
        #  nc <HOST> <PORT>
        print("TCP tunnel listening at:", tunnel.tcp_socket)
        run_echo_server(8000)
```

**SSH example:**
This assumes you have a rsa keypair in `~/.ssh/id_rsa{.pub}`, this is a bare-bones example
letting you SSH into a Modal container.

```python
import subprocess
import time

import modal

app = modal.App()
image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim()
    .apt_install("openssh-server")
    .run_commands("mkdir /run/sshd")
    .add_local_file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub", "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys", copy=True)
)


@app.function(image=image, timeout=3600)
def some_function():
    subprocess.Popen(["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-e"])
    with modal.forward(port=22, unencrypted=True) as tunnel:
        hostname, port = tunnel.tcp_socket
        connection_cmd = f'ssh -p {port} root@{hostname}'
        print(f"ssh into container using: {connection_cmd}")
        time.sleep(3600)  # keep alive for 1 hour or until killed
```

If you intend to use this more generally, a suggestion is to put the subprocess and port
forwarding code in an `@enter` lifecycle method of an @app.cls, to only make a single
ssh server and port for each container (and not one for each input to the function).
